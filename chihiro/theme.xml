				<text>Chihiro (also known as Sega Chihiro) is an arcade system board developed and used by Sega for a variety of high-end arcade releases in the early-to-mid 2000's. Originally released in 2002 with The House of the Dead III, Chihiro is a successor to the NAOMI series of boards and is based on Microsoft's Xbox console. It is Sega's last arcade board to be based on a particular console, with each successor (starting with Lindbergh) based on traditional PC architecture.</text>
